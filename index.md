Yes! Introducing the norm  

$$
\lVert \gamma\rVert  = |\gamma(0)| + \sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma(t)| + \sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma'(t)|
$$

makes the space **$ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $ complete**, turning it into a **Banach space**. This norm is stronger than the standard supremum norm on $ C^1 $, ensuring uniform convergence of both $ \gamma $ and $ \gamma' $. Let’s analyze how this impacts the problem.

---

### **Step 1: Why This Norm Helps with Continuity?**
With this norm, if $ \gamma_n \to \gamma $, then:
- $ \gamma_n(0) \to \gamma(0) $,
- $ \gamma_n \to \gamma $ **uniformly**,
- $ \gamma_n' \to \gamma' $ **uniformly**.

This is enough to apply the **dominated convergence theorem**, provided $ \text{Im}(\gamma_n) $ is bounded away from zero. Hence, $ f(\gamma_n) \to f(\gamma) $, proving continuity.

---

### **Step 2: How Compactness Can Be Ensured?**
Since the space is **complete**, we need to check whether a suitable subset is **precompact** to guarantee the existence of an infimum.

A subset of $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $ is compact if:
1. **Bounded in $ \lVert \gamma\rVert $**: There exist constants $ M, M_1 $ such that  
   $$
   |\gamma(0)| \leq M, \quad \lVert \gamma\rVert _\infty \leq M, \quad \lVert \gamma'\rVert _\infty \leq M_1.
   $$
   This ensures total boundedness.

2. **Lower Bound on $ \text{Im}(\gamma) $**: There exists $ \delta > 0 $ such that  
   $$
   \text{Im}(\gamma(t)) \geq \delta \quad \forall t \in [0,1].
   $$
   This prevents the denominator in $ f(\gamma) $ from degenerating.

With these conditions, the subset satisfies **the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem** and is compact in the $ C^1 $-topology. Since $ f $ is continuous, **$ f $ attains its infimum**.

---

### **Step 3: Role of $ \mathbb{H}^2 $ (Upper Half-Plane)**
The upper half-plane $ \mathbb{H}^2 $ plays a crucial role because:
- The function $ f(\gamma) $ depends on $ \text{Im}(\gamma) $, which must remain positive.
- The **hyperbolic metric** in $ \mathbb{H}^2 $ behaves differently from the Euclidean metric, but as long as $ \gamma $ remains bounded and avoids the real axis, the problem stays well-posed.
- The natural geometry of $ \mathbb{H}^2 $ could be leveraged to show coercivity of $ f $, meaning $ f(\gamma) \to \infty $ as $ \gamma $ approaches the boundary of the space.

---

### **Conclusion**
- The **new norm makes the space complete**, which helps in analyzing convergence.
- A **bounded subset with a lower bound on $ \text{Im}(\gamma) $ is compact**, ensuring that $ f $ attains its infimum.
- The **hyperbolic structure** affects the function but does not prevent compactness under proper constraints.

Would you like to explore how the hyperbolic metric explicitly affects $ f $?

## $\S$ How arzela ascoli theorem is applied please explain in details.

### **Applying the Arzelà–Ascoli Theorem to Ensure Compactness**  

The **Arzelà–Ascoli theorem** gives conditions under which a set of functions in $ C([0,1], \mathbb{R}^n) $ (or more generally in $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{R}^n) $) has a **compact closure** in the appropriate function space. Since we are dealing with $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $, let’s carefully analyze how to apply it.

---

### **Step 1: Arzelà–Ascoli Theorem (Classical Form)**
The theorem states that a subset $ S $ of $ C([0,1], \mathbb{R}^n) $ is **relatively compact** (i.e., its closure is compact) **if and only if**:
1. **Uniform Boundedness**: There exists a constant $ M $ such that for all $ \gamma \in S $,  

   $$
   \lVert \gamma \rVert_{\infty} = \sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma(t)| \leq M.
   $$

2. **Equicontinuity**: Given any $ \epsilon > 0 $, there exists $ \delta > 0 $ such that for all $ \gamma \in S $ and for all $ t_1, t_2 $ satisfying $ |t_1 - t_2| < \delta $, we have  
   $$
   |\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_2)| < \epsilon.
   $$

If these conditions hold, then every sequence $ (\gamma_n) $ in $ S $ has a **uniformly convergent subsequence**, ensuring compactness.

---

### **Step 2: Extension to $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $**
Now, we are working in $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $, which consists of continuously differentiable functions. The space is equipped with the norm:  
$$
\lVert \gamma\rVert = |\gamma(0)| + \sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma(t)| + \sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma'(t)|.
$$
To apply Arzelà–Ascoli, we need to check **relative compactness** in $ C^1 $, which means we must impose conditions on both $ \gamma $ and $ \gamma' $.

---

### **Step 3: Verifying the Conditions in $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $**
We consider a subset $ S \subset C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $ satisfying the following constraints:

#### **1. Uniform Boundedness of Functions $ \gamma $**
There exists a constant $ M $ such that for all $ \gamma \in S $,
$$
\sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma(t)| \leq M.
$$
This ensures that all functions in $ S $ are confined within a bounded region of $ \mathbb{H}^2 $.

#### **2. Uniform Boundedness of Derivatives $ \gamma' $**
There exists a constant $ M_1 $ such that for all $ \gamma \in S $,
$$
\sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma'(t)| \leq M_1.
$$
This ensures that the functions do not oscillate too wildly.

#### **3. Equicontinuity of $ \gamma $ (Using $ \gamma' $)**
For any $ \epsilon > 0 $, we can choose $ \delta > 0 $ such that for all $ \gamma \in S $ and for all $ t_1, t_2 $ with $ |t_1 - t_2| < \delta $,
$$
|\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_2)| = \left| \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \gamma'(s) ds \right| \leq \sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma'(t)| \cdot |t_1 - t_2| < M_1 \delta.
$$
Choosing $ \delta = \frac{\epsilon}{M_1} $, we guarantee equicontinuity.

#### **4. Equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $**
For compactness in $ C^1 $, we also need $ \gamma' $ to be **equicontinuous**. That is, we require that:
$$
\sup_{\gamma \in S} |\gamma''(t)| \leq M_2 \quad \text{for some } M_2.
$$
Then, for $ |t_1 - t_2| < \delta $,
$$
|\gamma'(t_1) - \gamma'(t_2)| = \left| \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \gamma''(s) ds \right| \leq M_2 |t_1 - t_2|.
$$
This ensures $ \gamma' $ is equicontinuous.

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**
By the **Arzelà–Ascoli theorem in $ C^1 $-topology**, the subset $ S $ satisfying the above conditions has **compact closure in $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $**. Since $ f $ is **continuous** in this topology, the **extreme value theorem** guarantees that $ f $ attains its infimum.

---

### **Step 5: Role of $ \mathbb{H}^2 $**
The function $ f(\gamma) $ involves $ \frac{|\gamma'(t)|}{\text{Im}(\gamma(t))} $. The lower bound $ \text{Im}(\gamma) \geq \delta > 0 $ ensures:
- The denominator is never too small.
- $ f $ remains well-defined and does not diverge to infinity.

Thus, restricting to functions that **stay in a compact region of $ \mathbb{H}^2 $** ensures that the conditions of Arzelà–Ascoli hold.

---

### **Final Answer**
By carefully **bounding** $ \gamma, \gamma' $, and ensuring **equicontinuity** (which follows from uniform bounds on $ \gamma' $ and $ \gamma'' $), we apply **Arzelà–Ascoli in $ C^1 $** to get **compactness** of the subset. This ensures that $ f $ attains its infimum.

Would you like me to illustrate this with a concrete example or a visualization?

## $\S$ Why we need 4th condition infact we don't know double derivative exists or not?

You're absolutely right! Since we are working in $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $, the second derivative $ \gamma''(t) $ may not exist in general, so imposing equicontinuity on $ \gamma' $ using bounds on $ \gamma'' $ is not valid. Let's refine the argument properly.

---

### **Revisiting the Arzelà–Ascoli Argument**
We need to ensure that a bounded subset of $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $ is **relatively compact**. The correct application of Arzelà–Ascoli in $ C^1 $-spaces requires:

1. **Uniform Boundedness of $ \gamma $**:  
   $$
   \sup_{\gamma \in S} \sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma(t)| \leq M.
   $$
   This ensures all functions remain in a bounded region.

2. **Uniform Boundedness of $ \gamma' $**:  
   $$
   \sup_{\gamma \in S} \sup_{t \in [0,1]} |\gamma'(t)| \leq M_1.
   $$
   This ensures derivatives do not grow arbitrarily large.

3. **Equicontinuity of $ \gamma $**:  
   For all $ \gamma \in S $, and for any $ t_1, t_2 $ with $ |t_1 - t_2| < \delta $,
   $$
   |\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_2)| = \left| \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \gamma'(s) ds \right| \leq \sup_{s \in [0,1]} |\gamma'(s)| \cdot |t_1 - t_2| \leq M_1 |t_1 - t_2|.
   $$
   This follows directly from the uniform bound on $ \gamma' $ and implies equicontinuity of $ \gamma $.

#### **Do We Need Equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $?**
For compactness in $ C^1 $, we typically require **relative compactness of derivatives**. The best way to ensure this **without assuming $ \gamma'' $ exists** is to use:

- **Uniform Lipschitz bound on $ \gamma' $**:  
  That is, for all $ \gamma \in S $,  
  $$
  |\gamma'(t_1) - \gamma'(t_2)| \leq L |t_1 - t_2|.
  $$
  This ensures equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $ and is sufficient for compactness.

---

### **Fixing the Compactness Argument**
To ensure that a bounded subset of $ C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $ is compact:
- We **do not** need $ \gamma'' $.
- We need a uniform **Lipschitz condition** on $ \gamma' $, i.e., $ \gamma' $ is equicontinuous.
- If a subset satisfies the Lipschitz condition, then Arzelà–Ascoli applies in $ C^1 $, and we conclude compactness.

Thus, we **drop the incorrect 4th condition** and replace it with a Lipschitz condition on $ \gamma' $, which follows if $ \gamma' $ is already bounded and varies smoothly.

Would you like an example of a function space where this applies naturally?

## $\S$ Why we need the equicontinuity of $\gamma'$?

### **Why Do We Need Equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $?**  

We need the equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $ because we want **compactness in $ C^1 $-topology**, not just in $ C^0 $ (the space of continuous functions). The Arzelà–Ascoli theorem applies directly to $ C^0 $, but for compactness in $ C^1 $, we must ensure not only that $ \gamma_n $ has a convergent subsequence, but also that $ \gamma_n' $ does.  

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**
Let’s break this down carefully.

#### **1. Compactness in $ C^0 $**
A subset $ S \subset C([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $ is compact if:
- The functions $ \gamma $ are **uniformly bounded**.
- The functions $ \gamma $ are **equicontinuous**, i.e., for all $ \epsilon > 0 $, there exists $ \delta > 0 $ such that  
  $$
  |t_1 - t_2| < \delta \Rightarrow |\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_2)| < \epsilon \quad \forall \gamma \in S.
  $$
- This ensures that every sequence $ (\gamma_n) $ has a **uniformly convergent subsequence**, meaning $ \gamma_n \to \gamma $ uniformly.

#### **2. Why This Is Not Enough for $ C^1 $ Compactness**
Even if $ \gamma_n \to \gamma $ **uniformly**, we are working in $ C^1 $, so we need to ensure that $ \gamma_n' $ also converges **uniformly** to $ \gamma' $.  
To guarantee this, we need an additional condition: **equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $**.

#### **3. What Happens Without Equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $?**
If $ \gamma_n' $ is only bounded but **not equicontinuous**, it can oscillate wildly, preventing uniform convergence. Consider this counterexample:

Let $ \gamma_n(t) $ be defined as:
$$
\gamma_n(t) = \frac{1}{n} \sin(n^2 t).
$$
Then:
$$
\gamma_n'(t) = \cos(n^2 t) \cdot n.
$$
Clearly:
- $ \gamma_n \to 0 $ uniformly.
- But $ \gamma_n' $ does **not** converge uniformly since it oscillates increasingly fast.
- Thus, $ \gamma_n $ does **not** converge in $ C^1 $.

This shows why a simple bound on $ \gamma' $ is insufficient; we need equicontinuity.

#### **4. Equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $ Guarantees Uniform Convergence**
To ensure compactness in $ C^1 $, we impose **equicontinuity** on $ \gamma' $. That is, we require that for all $ \epsilon > 0 $, there exists $ \delta > 0 $ such that
$$
|t_1 - t_2| < \delta \quad \Rightarrow \quad |\gamma'(t_1) - \gamma'(t_2)| < \epsilon, \quad \forall \gamma \in S.
$$
This ensures that $ \gamma_n' $ forms an equicontinuous family and thus has a **uniformly convergent subsequence**, guaranteeing compactness in $ C^1 $.

---

### **Final Conclusion**
- **Equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $ ensures uniform convergence of derivatives.**  
- This is **crucial** for compactness in $ C^1 $, as boundedness alone is not enough.  
- Arzelà–Ascoli applies separately to $ \gamma $ and $ \gamma' $, so we need both conditions for $ C^1 $-compactness.  

Thus, the **corrected compactness criteria** for a subset $ S \subset C^1([0,1], \mathbb{H}^2) $ are:
1. **Uniform boundedness** of $ \gamma $ and $ \gamma' $.
2. **Equicontinuity** of $ \gamma $.
3. **Equicontinuity** of $ \gamma' $ (to ensure uniform convergence in $ C^1 $).  

Would you like an explicit proof showing how equicontinuity of $ \gamma' $ forces uniform convergence?
